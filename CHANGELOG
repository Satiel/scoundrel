	* Added item layer that can be drawn over the map layer, under the player layer
	* Added a few basic item types
	* Added code for properly drawing item layer

		on the ground, as long as there is nothing in that spot
	* Fixed bug where inventory slots weren't getting written properly after dropping 
	  an item that was previously in the player's inventory

		Ex. You hit 'o' to open door but 'o' would also type on the screen, which looks stupid.
